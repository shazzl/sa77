  exFAT is a proposed replacement for FAT32 that addresses many of its limitations. 
  One of the major flaws of FAT32 is the rapid fragmentation of files. 
  This is because the constant creation and deletion of files creates noncontiguous areas of free space. 
  When large files are placed into these spaces, they are broken into many pieces to fit. 
  exFAT uses a free space bitmap just like other modern file systems. 
  This allows exFAT to find contiguous space where the file will fit, thereby reducing the occurrence of fragmentation.
  Check this for enabling exfat support in your ROM - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=39936020&posted=1#post39936020
* Revert to stock voltages and Undervolt each frequency by -25mV
* Remove 192 MHz and set 288 MHz as min ( I noticed higher battery drain at 192 MHz)
* Kernel will boot at my own recommended settings : (No need to change them if you aren't absolutely sure)
  * mpdecision off
  * intelli_plug on
  * default governor - intellidemand
  * default min frequency - 288 MHz
  * default GPU max frequency - 400 MHz
* Remove more debugging
* Kernel and modules combined into single flashable recovery zip

>----Version 2.2----
* Disable intelli_plug for now and re-enable MPDecision
 - Offers better performance 
 - More battery efficient
 - is reliable
* Max Cpu clock set to 1026 MHz -- fixes wakeup lag
* Extra modules separated from kernel zip
  - cifs.ko
  - ntfs.ko
  - fuse.ko
  - tun.ko
  - nls_utf8.ko
  - exfat_core.ko & exfat_fs.ko  -- exfat modules
  - hid-sony.ko  -- sony ps3 controller module
Users can cherrypick the required module they want and place it in /system/lib/modules and set perm r-w-r-r
Please note that insmoding modules may affect device performance and battery life
